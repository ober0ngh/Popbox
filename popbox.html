				<h1>Project</h1>
				<h2>About the Project</h2> 
				<p> Team Popbox is a group of five masters
					students in the Human-Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie
					Mellon University. Each team member has a unique skillset and set
					of experiences that guides their approach to user-centered research
					and design. We are currently engaged in an 8-month capstone
					project, which represents the culmination of our studies at
					Carnegie Mellon University. During this 8-month period, we
					research, design, and develop a conceptual prototype for an
					industry sponsor. We are currently working with Panasonic R&D on a
					solution that will help address the growing childhood obesity
					epidemic. 
				</p>
				<h2> Project Overview </h2> 
				<p> Team Popbox practices a user-centered
					research approach with a strong focus on field work. However, we
					first reviewed the vast body of existing literature on childhood
					obesity to ensure that our field work was actually exploring new
					ground and was conducted in a manner sensitive to the social stigma
					surrounding childhood obesity.

				<h1>Literature Review</h1>
				<p>Our literature review was particularly important to our
					research process given the wide body of research already available
					on childhood obesity. We conducted an exhaustive review of over
					fifty research papers on the subject in order to gain an in-depth
					understanding of the problem space. This review enabled us to
					familiarize ourselves with existing treatments for childhood
					obesity as well as ensure that our fieldwork was focused on
					answering questions that had not been adequately addressed by
					existing literature.</p>

				<h1>Competitive Landscape</h1>
				<p>Our literature review indicated that there was a wide variety
					of existing solutions designed to combat obesity, and even more so
					that addressed the idea of weight management and personal fitness
					in general. To understand the breadth of existing solutions we
					conducted a competitive analysis of these solutions, dividing these
					competitors into the following categories: exercise, information,
					dieting, communication, and game-centered solutions.</p>

					<h1>Expert Interview</h1>
					<p>There is a vast amount of knowledge surrounding childhood
						obesity that exists within the expertise of various educators,
						health-care professionals, and program organizers. We reached out
						to these experts to take advantage of the wealth of knowledge they
						offered regarding person-person motivation, policy changes, and
						education about childhood obesity.</p>

					<h1>Guerilla Observation</h1>
					<p>We identified and visited several locations frequented by
						families with young children. During these visits we paid close
						attention to any critical nutritional and fitness choices that
						were made at these locations, how each location affected those
						choices, and the manner in which caretakers and children
						communicated with one another.</p>

					<h1>Family Storytelling</h1>
					<p>Our extensive literature review strongly suggested that a
						family-centered solution was the most effective approach in the
						fight against childhood obesity. With this in mind, we conducted a
						series of activities with families that encouraged family members
						to collaborate and walk us through specific stories from their
						daily lives. These activities were designed to elicit information
						regarding the day-to-day choices families made surrounding
						nutrition and fitness.</p>
